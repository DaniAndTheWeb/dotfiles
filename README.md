# DaniAndTheWeb's dotfiles
My Arch+Sway dotfiles

I must give credits to the awesome [EndeavourOS Community Edition](https://github.com/EndeavourOS-Community-Editions/sway) for their awesome sway configuration that has been the base for my personal one.

## Configuration
After copying all the files inside the ".config" folder remember to set the execute permission for all the contents inside "~/.config/sway/scripts/" as it is necessary to enable the gtk theming and the gamma controller.
